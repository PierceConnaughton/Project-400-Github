violent crime is rising across the united states, yet the dnc convention ignored it. crime reduction will be one of my top priorities. just got back from colorado. the love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible. big crowds!

no one has worse judgement than hillary clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes. hillarys wars in the middle east have unleashed destruction, terrorism and isis across the world. hillarys vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety. hillary will never reform wall street. she is owned by wall street! our way of life is under threat by radical islam and hillary clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words. hillarys refusal to mention radical islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country. departing now - thank you cedar rapids, iowa. this is a movement!

the democratic convention has paid zero respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. no recognition - sad! funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing dems narrative that russia is working for me because putin said \"trump is a genius.\" america 1st!

waste of time. elizabeth warren, often referred to as pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about crooked hillary, who she always hated! sad to watch bernie sanders abandon his revolution. we welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs. if cory booker is the future of the democratic party, they have no future! i know more about cory than he knows about himself. i was at @foxnews and met juan williams in passing.  he asked if he could have pictures taken with me. i said fine. he then trashes on air! hard to believe that bernie sanders has done such a complete fold. he got nothing for all of the time, energy and money. the v.p. a joke! while bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers. clinton betrayed bernie voters. kaine supports tpp, is in pocket of wall street, and backed iraq war. thank you ohio!

wow, the republican convention went so smoothly compared to the dems total mess. but fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn! here we go again with another clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). crooked hillary knew the fix was in, b never had a chance! crooked hillary clinton knew everything that her \"servant\" was doing at the dnc - they just got caught, thats all! they laughed at bernie. if bernie sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same. thank you! #makeamericagreatagain   hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened! how much bad judgement was on display by the people in dnc in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against bernie! the new joke in town is that russia leaked the disastrous dnc e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because putin likes me watched crooked hillary clinton and tim kaine on 60 minutes. no way they are going to fix americas problems. isis &amp; all others laughing! the ratings for the republican national convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. thank you! the highly neurotic debbie wasserman schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a crooked hillary victory, shes out! the democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! e-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp; well! even though bernie sanders has lost his energy and his strength, i dont believe that his supporters will let crooked hillary off the hook! crooked hillary clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, dws. too bad bernie flamed out if the republican convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (bernie), media would go wild the @cnn panels are so one sided, almost all against trump. @foxnews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. dont watch cnn! i always said that debbie wasserman schultz was overrated. the dems convention is cracking up and bernie is exhausted, no energy left! today proves what i have always known, that @reince priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not debbie wasserman shultz (@dwstweets.) sorry folks, but bernie sanders is exhausted, just cant go on any longer. he is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and dnc disrespect. sad! there is no longer a bernie sanders \"political revolution.\" he is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end! an analysis showed that bernie sanders would have won the democratic nomination if it were not for the super delegates. looks like the bernie people will fight. if not, their blood, sweat and tears was a total waste of time. kaine stands for opposite! wow, president obamas brother, malik, just announced that he is voting for me. was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else! bernie sanders started off strong, but with the selection of kaine for v.p., is ending really weak. so much for a movement! total disrespect the crooked hillary v.p. choice is very disrespectful to bernie sanders and all of his supporters. just another case of bad judgement by h! #makeamericagreatagain\\n#trumppence16   \"@nancynielsenn: @realdonaldtrump dinesh dsousa hillarys america. see it\" \"@olimauritania: @realdonaldtrump kaine supported the stupidest deal in the history of deals   #hillarykaine2016\" thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on thursday night. from the heart!

i will bring jobs back and get wages up. people havent had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. clinton killed jobs! tim kaine has been praising the trans pacific partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. job killer! funny that the democrats would have their convention in pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. i will bring jobs back! crooked hillary clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in pennsylvania. against steelworkers and miners. husband signed nafta. leaked e-mails of dnc show plans to destroy bernie sanders. mock his heritage and much more. on-line from wikileakes, really vicious. rigged pocahontas wanted v.p. slot so badly but wasnt chosen because she has done nothing in the senate. also, crooked hillary hates her! tim kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. bernie fought for nothing! the bernie sanders supporters are furious with the choice of tim kaine, who represents the opposite of what bernie stands for. philly fight? \"@theresa_cali: @realdonaldtrump general michael flynn will make a great secretary of defense when you become potus!

the rigged system may have helped hillary clinton escape criminal charges, but...    crooked hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement. crooked hillary clinton and her team \"were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.\" not fit! crooked hillary clinton is unfit to serve as president of the u.s. her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. bad judgement! i dont think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed crooked hillary to get away with \"murder.\" come november 8, shes out!

crooked hillary clinton is \"guilty as hell\" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! where are the 33,000 missing e-mails? the only people who are not interested in being the v.p. pick are the people who have not been asked! i look forward to meeting @joniernst today in new jersey. she has done a great job as senator of iowa! spent time with indiana governor mike pence and family yesterday. very impressed, great people! senator tom cotton was great on meet the press yesterday. despite a totally one-sided interview by chuck todd, the end result was solid! dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the star of david rather than a sheriffs star, or plain star! happy 4th of july! #trump2016 #americafirst     crooked hillary will never be able to handle the complexities and danger of isis - it will just go on forever. we need change! the third mass attack (slaughter) in days by isis. 200 dead in baghdad, worst in many years. we do not have leadership that can stop this! in bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by isis terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the koran. 20 were killed! i believe that crooked hillary sent bill to have the meeting with the u.s.a.g. so bill is not in trouble with h except that he got caught! the secret meeting between bill clinton and the u.s.a.g. in back of closed plane was heightened with fbi shouting \"go away, no pictures.\" does anybody really believe that bill clinton and the u.s.a.g. talked only about \"grandkids\" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac? \"the system is rigged!\" on saturday a great man, elie wiesel, passed away.the world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil! crooked hillary clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the u.s.a.g. to work out a deal. the system is totally rigged &amp; corrupt! only a fool would believe that the meeting between bill clinton and the u.s.a.g. was not arranged or that crooked hillary did not know. just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me chuck todd, and the entire show, is against me.the good news-the people get it! it was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against crooked hillary clinton. like i said, the system is totally rigged! it is impossible for the fbi not to recommend criminal charges against hillary clinton. what she did was wrong! what bill did was stupid! thank you @greta. #imwithyou   thank you for your support!\\n#americafirst #leadright2016    rt @gop: reminder: last year, clinton pledged she had turned over all work-related email under penalty of perjury    thank you!

take a look at what happened w/ bill clinton. the system is totally rigged. does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence? bill clintons meeting was a total secret. nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter. as bernie sanders said, hillary clinton has bad judgement. bills meeting was probably initiated and demanded by hillary! #throwbackthursday #trump2016\\n  i will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 10pm on fox! enjoy! the reason i put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple, i want to make america great again! i have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. i have totally terminated the loan! the very dishonest @nbcnews refuses to accept the fact that i have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. done deal! one of the reasons hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldnt see how she got rich- selling out america.\\n  why would college graduates want crooked hillary as their president? she will destroy them!\\n  new book by @ericbolling is absolutely terrific and a must read! #wakeupamerica the story with hillary will never change.   rt @drudge_report: 43-39   for reasons only they can explain, the @uschamber wants to continue our bad trade deals rather than renegotiating and making them better. tremendous day in massachusetts and maine. thank you to everyone for making it so special!

wow, an all trump night on @foxnews   kelly file at 9:00 p.m. and @seanhannity at 10:00 p.m. enjoy! i should have easily won the trump university case on summary judgement but have a judge, gonzalo curiel, who is totally biased against me. i have a judge in the trump university civil case, gonzalo curiel (san diego), who is very unfair. an obama pick. totally biased-hates trump i hope everyone had a great memorial day!

the voter violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of f) and told them to clear it up by voting for cruz. fraud many people voted for cruz over carson because of this cruz fraud. also, cruz sent out a voter violation certificate to thousands of voters. during primetime of the iowa caucus, cruz put out a release that @realbencarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for cruz. ted cruz didnt win iowa, he stole it. that is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. bad!
